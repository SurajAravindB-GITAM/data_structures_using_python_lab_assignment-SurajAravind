# data_structures_with_Python_lab
This is a repository for Second Semester students to submit their programs of Data Structures with Python lab

_This Lab provides hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and using the most-commonly used data structures including arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, hash tables and graphs. Implementation different searching and sorting algorithms is also done._

**List of Practical Experiments:**

1. Python sample programs for practice

   - [Find minimum among three numbers.](01_1_min_3_numbers.py)
   - [Find the GCD and LCM of two/three numbers]()
   - Check whether the given number is perfect
   - Print Twin Primes up to a Specified limit.
   - Print the prime numbers up to a specified limit.
   - Find the sum of digits of a number. Check whether given number is Armstrong number or not.
   - Swap of Two numbers
   - Performs all the five arithmetic operations.

2. Write a program to read a linear list of items and store it in an array.

   - Copy the contents from one array to another array
   - Copy the contents from one array to another array in reverse order
   - Delete the duplicate elements from an array.

3. Write programs for:

   - Representing sparse matrix
   - Sparse matrix addition
   - Sparse matrix transpose

4. Write a program to Perform Linear Search and Binary Search on a list stored in an array.
5. Write a program to create a singly linked list for the following operations

   - Insert a Node at Beginning, at Ending and at a given Position
   - Delete a Node at Beginning, at Ending and at a given Position
   - Search, Count the Number of Nodes and Display

6. Write a program to create a doubly linked list for the following operations

   - Insert a Node at Beginning, at Ending and at a given Position
   - Delete a Node at Beginning, at Ending and at a given Position
   - Search, Count the Number of Nodes and Display

7. Write a program to create a Circular singly linked list for adding and deleting a Node.
8. Write a program to create a stack and perform various operations on it.
9. Write a program to convert the infix expression into postfix form.
10. Write a program to create a queue and perform various operations on it.
11. Write a program to create a binary tree and perform various traversals.
12. Write a program to create a binary search tree and perform search operation.
13. Write a program to implement Depth First Search, Breadth First Search traversals on a graph.
14. Write a program to implement Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
15. Write a program to implement various sorting techniques: [Compare with Python's Built-In Sorting Functions also]

    - Insertion sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Bubble Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
